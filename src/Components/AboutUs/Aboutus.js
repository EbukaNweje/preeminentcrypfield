           Since you are on the About us page, we have to introduce ourselves.<br/>So...Hello, we are a friendly preeminent crypfield team.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           <br/>
           It makes no sense to introduce a whole team of techies, designers and analysts, you can only be a director.<br/>Is that ok?Well, if it is, then an introductory word from our founder

            The idea of ​​creating the preeminent crypfield project originated in 2017 when the cryptocurrency market was especially volatile. High <br/> volatility made me think about arbitrage deals. These transactions were supposed to be super-fast, and as we know, transferring funds to<br/> the exchange and between them takes a lot of time. Then I remembered the strategy of "Triangular (triple) arbitrage." This strategy can be<br/> used within the framework of 1 exchange and carry out fast transactions via API. I called my school friend, who at that time was already a<br/> successful developer, and I asked him to write a small test app for one of the exchanges leading at that time. In 3 hours I had a raw version <br/>of the trading bot, which worked almost as I wanted it to.<br/>There were fails, stuttering, belated orders, but this was only a draft version. Soon we hired analysts for training the bot to work in<br/>emergency situations - PUMP / DUMP - you can earn the most from them with triple arbitrage trading. By that time, my friend (who was a<br/> developer) had already made an almost full-fledged bot, and we started making money and still do.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The idea originated in 2015, so why the platform was launched in 2018?
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The thing is that volatility has decreased since 2017, the bear market prevailed. In 2018, we had to upgrade the bot to a bear market and<br/> quick liquidation. Until mid-2018, we were still making edits and training the trading bot for our arbitrage. In early January 2019, we realized<br/> that the bot works perfectly with different movements, force majeure is excluded, so we decided to open our own company. We hired<br/> lawyers, marketing experts, and decided to adhere to the basic principles of the Internet company (anonymity and security for users). But<br/> again, the business stopped, lawyers said that we should adhere to the KYC and AML policies, which we categorically could not allow<br/> because we care about decentralization, anonymity and user safety. After all, KYC and AML did not protect a single exchange user from<br/> “exit-scam”, but only limited the possibilities of the sites and prevented the injection of money. I dare to assume there is “exit-scam” in<br/> famous exchanges, of course, not including force majeure circumstances like hacker atacks. We began to prepare documents, consult, and<br/> in October 2019, we officially registered our company under Hong Kong jurisdiction. A few months took to develop the platform and <br/>connect our trading bots, and now ... the platform was launched in the middle of April 2020.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            How did we open a company without KYC / AML?
            <br/>
            <br/>
            We work with leading analytical companies that track dark and gray transactions. As soon as such funds get into our system, we<br/> temporarily block our account before the proceedings, while ordinary users can easily withdraw up to 150 BTC per day without passing any<br/> verification. Based on the experience of other cryptocurrency companies, this is the best solution for ordinary users.
